	<p>This is Qian Pin, pronunced by Champion. Just let the 'h' go, you can call me Campion! </p>
	<p>Currently, Iâ€™m a BSc student majoring in the Information and Computing Science Programme at The University of Liverpool.</p>
	<p>I picked up some sports when I came to the UK. I really enjoy the process of hiking because it makes me feel the freedom of being a tiny creature in nature. I also enjoy windsurfing because I can feel that I can control the direction of movement in the process of fighting against the wind.</p>
	<p>My current research interests are goal conditioned reinforcement learning algorithms on portfolio optimization, as well as exploration strategy for efficient agent training.</p>
	<p>"what I cannot share, I do not understand." I especially agree with the saying. I'am trying to documente my learning notes and record trivial life thoughts in this blog. </p>
	<p>Of course, different voices are welcome! </p>
